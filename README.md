<h2 align="center">Completed Course no.1</h2>
<p align="center">March 4th marks the day i completed and finished my first course on freeCodeCamp.org. Im really satisfied and happy with the progress i've made and the lessons i've learned along the way. <p>
<p align="center">Over the last two months, i've started to regularly follow lessons and tutorials on the course, making the journey fun with some custom projects that i had to create myself without anyones help.
The Course taught me how to code in HTML and CSS, how to align items, how to recognize different types of code, how to center a div...</p>
